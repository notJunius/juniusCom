Basically a personalized version of notion for myself. I am gonna try and replace all of my notebooks i use with one website for myself.

## Features:
[] a milanote, infinite board page
[] a fitness tracker, connected to hevy
[] spotify embedded
[] a calendar
[] a journal, with nvim bindings
[] a dropdown to a bunch of awesome links I wanna bookmark
[] link the gospel library app and see if I can have the scriptures show with my own custom theme, and link it to the church's api
